#### What went well
* team was willing and able to meet outside of class and therby was able to quickly learn the skills we lacked.
*

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* We initially went to the wrong direction of this project by creating a client side Distance calculator. When we realized what the actual task was we were able to move on it and finish quickly.
* JavaScript is new knowledge for us. It takes us a lot of time to figure it out how does these code work and how to add buttons on it.
* Testing was lacking this sprint not everyone knew how to do it and that caused a number of issues before we caught them. we will be meeting this saturday to plan how we will improve in this regard.

## Retrospective
The team did an exelent job getting up to speed on what we had to do and what we will need to improve on for the next sprint. All the tasks were compleated on time this sprint but next time there will be a lot more code that needs to be writen and we will need to plan for more learning time to account for that.

#### What went well
* Although each of us have different working habits and schedules, we still can meet together in the lab and work on the issues.
* Everyone can help each other when we met some difficulties.

#### Potential improvements
* We will be meeting to discuss how github and intellij work so we can improve the way we submit code

#### What we will change next time
* Should talk to the TA or other teams earilier if we do have certain issues that we are not very sure.
* JavaScript is a new language for us. We need to spend more time learning it than most groups.
