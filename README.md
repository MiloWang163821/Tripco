I am junior CS student at CSU taking this class along with Operating Systems. I am hoping that my experience interning with a memory company (Micron) will help the team. I am excited about finishing the project.

# Manifesto
  We are dedicated to building an efficient and easy to manage aplicaton that will both allow us to grow our skills and be usefull to us as we interview for jobs. To this end we have dedicated ourselvs to the task of delivering a lightweight, user friendly web application in an agile team environment. With regular meetings to discus progress and best practices we will strive to deliver on time progress that has been rigorusly tested.
  Additionaly we intend to build our project with efficient test driven development practices. In doing so we hope to ensure that our master is never broken and that there is no need to scrap valuble work that we have put into the project due to carelessness.

  We are also interested in making our code efficient. Efficient code is much more managable and provides a much better user experience because there is much less noticable delay from the server. We plan to do this by testing and profiling. Then, less effiecent code will be found and upgraded to more efficient code.   

  A core value of our group is communication. Using tools such as text, slack, github, and (of course) word-of-mouth, our group can coordinate our efforts toward a common goal. We will make sure others understand any changes we make to the software and resolve any conflicts that may arise. With this, our final program will be bug-free and ready to use.
  
  Another value is the that every teammates should help each other. I believe that everyone has their own skill. Sometimes people get confused about something but you cannot just take other people's job to finish it without communication.
