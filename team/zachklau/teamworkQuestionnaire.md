Teamwork Questionnaire for Zachary Klausner

1. Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else? What hours?
  - Text and email are great. I don't have voice mail right now.

2. What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
  - I expect to meet the requirements of all assignments and turn in quality work.

3. What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
  - I hope to gain experience with working with others on programming tasks and I hope to improve my ability to communicate efficiently.

4. What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
  - Teammates may have different goals. Some may have less or more self motivation.

5. What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
  - The people who want an "A" can try to persuade the others to work just a little bit more.

6. Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
  - No

7. How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
  - At least 10 hours.

8. How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
  - People can state their strengths/weaknesses and work can be split based off those.

9. What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
  - We can have a discussion with them and if it repeatedly happens then we can seek instructor advice.

10. What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
  - We can help them improve and discuss with them what changes we think should be made.

11. How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
  - Different work habits are fine unless it affects the quality of work. If it does affect quality then we can discuss what can be  done.
  
12. Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
   - I think that might be a good idea if there is not enough time in class.

13. How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
  - At least once a week.

14.Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
  - For small changes or actions no, for large changes or actions yes.

15. What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
  - Talk about why they disagree. If it risks us missing a deadline then majority rule should go into effect.

16. What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
  - If they are capable and effective then I am all for leadership. If it becomes overbearing then we should have a discussion.

17. What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
  - Try and get others to communicate more. If it becomes an issue then seek advice from an instructor.
